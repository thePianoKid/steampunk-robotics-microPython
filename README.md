# Python for EV3 ðŸ¤–

The following programs were written for students who had perchased [LEGO's EV3 robotics kit](https://education.lego.com/en-us/start/mindstorms-ev3#Setting-Up). The `main.py` file is run on the [CPU](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ev3-intelligent-brick-45500), which is running MicroPython.

This repo is supposed to be a reference point if you are unsure as to how to start programming the EV3 in Python. For more information, please reference [LEGO's website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3).
